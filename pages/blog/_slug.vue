                                        <p><strong>We've always known the power of digital, and we've mastered the strategy, tactics, and technology to harness it. Now, other departments have had to embrace the digital transformation that busine- sses have been talking about for so long, and those colleagues are turning to us in Marketing to provide guidance.</strong></p>

                                        <p>Even if it is a brave new world for everyone else, for marketers it's another day in the proverbial office.</p>

                                        <p>Now, the digital evolution is resonating across organizations. The pandemic has shifted internal structures and changed relationships with customers, and as a result marketers have become more valuable than ever.</p>

                                        <p><strong>The Shift Inside Organizations: Marketers Become Indispensable in a Digital World.</strong></p>

                                        <p>Marketing has often been known as the department that makes PowerPoints and polishes websites. That wasn't ever close to the whole truth, of course, but past company structures — in which Marketing always played second fiddle to Sales — allowed that falsehood to persist.</p>

                                        <p>The pandemic has transformed what the marketing team means to an organization: It's given us agency. It's upended the customer journey. It's redefined how sales and marketing teams should interact. And it's forced businesses to see the value that marketers provide in a digital world.</p>
